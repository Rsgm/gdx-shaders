gdx-shaders
===========

I am using Github to host TheSecretPie's gdx-shaders project, [found here](https://bitbucket.org/Thotep/gdx-shaders/wiki/Home).

I need this so I can use the git plugin for gradle to get and build this project.

I am keeping the original license, apache 2.0. No code has been changed, the only difference is that it is hosted on github and it uses git instead of mercurial.
